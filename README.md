you need pyautogui with pyscreeze, time and ctypes
it also only works right now for python 3.12 might work for newer later IDK it depends on pyscreeze

I asked if this was allowed when I started it I got allowed I can not guarantee that it will be allowed when you use it so either ask for permission or use at own risk
this is a VERY vibe coded project of mine because I have never done something like this before so it was a learning opportunity for me
it can probably be better BUT I wont change shit "if it ain't broke don't fix it"

either way have fun with it and use at own risk (again)
